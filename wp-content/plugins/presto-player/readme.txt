== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Presto Player host my video files? =
Presto Player offers multiple hosting location options for your web-optimized videos. With our free version can self host your video or use Youtube or Vimeo. Our Pro version includes deep integration with Bunny.net.

In addition, any video host that gives you a public link to the video can be used with Presto Player, including HLS streams. [Learn How](https://prestoplayer.com/docs/how-to-use-presto-player-with-any-video-host)

Soon we will be adding Amazon S3 and all the various services that also use the same API such as Wasabi and Digital Ocean.

= Does Presto Player work with my page builder =
Presto Player will work with all page builders. You simply add a video to the Media Hub and use the 
provided shortcode in your page builder. However Presto Player also provides native Gutenberg Blocks, 
Elementor, and Beaver Builder. We are planning on creating a native integration with Divi, 
and Oxygen Builder that will function exactly like our Elementor widget does.

= Does Presto Player work with LearnDash's video progression? =
Yes, it most certainly does! And just like everything else we do, its very easy to use. Head on over to 
our [integrations page](https://prestoplayer.com/docs-category/integrations) to see how easy it is.

= What does "web optimized video" mean? =
When you create a video that you want to display on your website, it first needs to be transcoded in a web-optimized format. When using a service such as YouTube, you can upload a video in any format and YouTube will transcode it for you. However, when you are self-hosting your video or using one of our integrations such as BunnyNet, you first need to [transcode your video](https://prestoplayer.com/docs/how-to-optimize-video-for-smooth-website-playback-using-handbrake).

It's a very simple and easy process that we have created an easy to follow tutorial on, however if you skip this step your video viewers will most likely have issues with video playback.

= How do I get captions created for my Presto Player videos? =
There are many caption creation services available. We use HappyScribe because we like the interface and features they provide, but you can use any captioning service. Your captions need to be exported in the industry standard VTT format.

= Does Presto Player secure my videos? =
Presto Player Pro offers a public and private video option. Private videos are only accessible when a user is logged into your website. In addition Presto Player will use dynamic expiring links to your private videos.

Is cases where someone may want to dig through the html on your web page where a video is to try and find the url, that url will not work.

In addition, BunnyNet will be adding video encryption which will further video security.

Lastly, soon we will be releasing our dynamic overlays feature which will optionally enable you to show the logged in users details as a watermark overlay to discourage screen recording. This is something only possible with Presto Player because it's deeply integrated with WordPress.

= What is the cost of using BunnyNet? =
One of the main advantages of using Presto Player is our integration with BunnyNet to store and deliver your media. Presto Player will set everything up for you and the cost is extremely affordable.

You will be paying for 2 things, storage and bandwidth. Storage will cost between $0.01 – $0.03 per gigabyte stored per month. To give you an example, I have two online courses and combined all the videos take up 0.69 gigabytes. So my anticipated cost per month is $0.03 to store the videos with them.

The next cost is for bandwidth. If you have 1 video that is 10 megabytes, each time that video is fully viewed it will consume 10 megabytes of bandwidth. The cost of bandwidth is $0.005 per gigabyte transferred. So if you use 100 gigabytes of bandwidth per month, you will be paying $0.50 per month.

See our [BunnyNet cost calculator](https://prestoplayer.com/docs/how-to-use-bunnynet-with-presto-player).

It is also important to point out that BunnyNet has a $1 per month minimum.
